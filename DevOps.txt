DevOps:
DevOps = Development + Operations
It’ s a culture + set of practices + tools that help:
•	Developers (who write code)
•	Operations (who deploy/manage systems)
Work together, instead of working in silos.

Real-Time Example:
Imagine you are building a mobile app like Swiggy.
•	The developer writes code to add “Track My Order” feature.
•	Without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team – they manually – deploy – bugs happen – delays.
•	With DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployed – customers get updates faster and safely.

DevOps helps You:
•	Release features faster (like adding new payment methods in Zomato)
•	Fix bugs quickly (like fixing login issue in IRCTC)
•	Automate repetitive tasks (like server restarts, database backups)





DevOps Lifecycle:
-	8 phases of DevOps Lifecycle:
1.Plan:
-	Define what to build
2. Develop:
-	Write the code
3.Build:
-	Compile code into deployable format
4.Test:
-	Check for bugs automatically
5.Release:
-	Approve the build for deployment
6.Deploy:
-	Push app to servers or app store
7.Operate:
-	Keep app running, fix any issues
8.Monitor:
-	Analyze performance and feedback

Cycle continues: Feedback from users – back to plan.
